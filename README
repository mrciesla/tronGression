I believe you need these package the readme for python-mysqldb was vague
pkgs = ["mysql-server", "python-setuptools",  "zlibc", "openssl", "gcc", "wget", "python-mysqldb"]

you can run ./install if you want it will just check those packages and install
what is not there.

Once that is going the ./regressionCheck -i will create a new database and the
needed tables

#Add a test
./regressionCheck -a canonicalTestName scriptToGenerateTestOutput
#Run a test
./regressionCheck -r canonicalTestName
#Run a set of tests
./regressionCheck -R canonicalTestName1 canonicalTestName2 ....

scriptToGenerateTestOutput
first line is the output to compare against
the rest generates the output
ie:
grepOutput
grep "print" * > grepOuput
